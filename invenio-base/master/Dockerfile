# WORKAROUND: invenio-setup-environment checks for the presence of the
#             CFG_INVENIO_HOSTNAME variable in the .bashrc file and
#             adds one, when not is present. This results into using
#             the hostname of the machine during building the image,
#             which in turn sets the variable to an unacceptable random
#             SHA value during the build execution.

# update the repository sources list
RUN apt-get update

# install git-core
# WORKAROUND: Currently, invenio is checking the apache2 version by
#             using `locate` to search the executable, followed by
#             grep-ing out the version string. There is a faulty 
#             assumption that the locate package is installed on
#             every system and that `updatedb` is triggered by the
#             package manager. We need to install both locate and 
#             apache2 before kickstarting invenio, in order to have
#             the apache2 binary already in the locate database.
RUN apt-get install -y git wget locate apache2

# update the locate database
RUN updatedb

# create and change into code/ directory
# WORKAROUND: Docker is having problems with changing working directory
#             to `/`. Hence `invenio/` and `invenio-devscripts/` are 
#             being manipulated in the `/code/` directory. This might 
#             (but also might not) change in future versions.
